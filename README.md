**Everything you need to build a serious desktop app with [Effect](https://effect.website) and Electron.** A shell that supervises a local Effect server, typed RPC and IPC everywhere, and one React build that runs in the shell _and_ in your browser.

## 🤔 Why should I use this?

Most Electron starters give you a window and a bundler, then leave the hard parts to you — process supervision, secure IPC, auth, reconnect logic, packaging landmines. This one ships with the hard parts already solved, as Effect programs end to end.

- ⚡️ **Effect v4 everywhere** — the Electron main process, the server, and the client transport are all Effect programs: Layers, typed errors, scoped cleanup
- 🔒 **Typed wires** — every RPC and IPC message is an `effect/Schema` contract, validated on both sides
- 🛡️ **Secure by default** — sandboxed renderer, context isolation, secrets passed over fd 3 (never argv or env), bearer auth on the WebSocket
- 🔄 **Reconnects that just work** — one supervisor, capped backoff, streams re-attach themselves after every blip
- 🌐 **Develop in the browser** — the same web build runs in the Electron shell and in a plain browser tab with HMR
- 🖥️ **A supervised backend** — the shell health-checks the server before showing a window, and restarts it with backoff if it dies
- 📦 **Packaging solved** — electron-builder wiring with the ESM/CJS and Node-version landmines already defused
- 🤖 **Agent-ready** — `AGENTS.md` conventions and the Effect source vendored in-repo, so coding agents read real code instead of guessing

## ⚡️ Quick start

Requires Node 24 and pnpm 11.

```bash
npx degit AdiRishi/electron-effect-starter my-app
cd my-app
pnpm install
pnpm rename my-app com.mycompany  # make the starter yours (name, product name, app id, data dir)
pnpm dev            # server + web UI in your browser, with HMR
```

```bash
pnpm dev:desktop    # the real Electron shell
pnpm dist:desktop   # build a distributable installer
pnpm check          # typecheck + lint + format
pnpm test           # vitest across every package
```

No `.env` needed — ports are derived per checkout, so multiple clones never collide.

```

- **The shell owns the server.** It picks the port, spawns the server, probes its health endpoint, and reveals the window only when the backend answers.
- **Trust is minted once.** A per-launch token reaches the server over fd 3, gets exchanged for a bearer, and is checked once — at the WebSocket upgrade.
- **Exactly one thing reconnects.** The connection supervisor is the only retrier; a browser opened before the server starts simply converges on "Connected".
- **One build, two hosts.** Bridge present → shell. Bridge absent → browser fallbacks. Components never branch on the host.

The `docs/` folder has the full story behind every decision.

## 📝 The sample app: synced notes

The UI is a deliberately small notes app that exercises every seam the starter builds: schema-validated mutations (`notes.create` / `update` / `delete`), a snapshot-then-live push-bus subscription (`notes.subscribe`), atomic persistence in the server's data dir, and typed domain errors. Open `pnpm dev` in a browser tab **and** `pnpm dev:desktop` side by side — a note flashes in every window as each change round-trips through the local server. That's the whole architecture, visible.

It's built to be deleted: the domain lives in exactly four bounded places — `packages/contracts/src/notes.ts` (+ its `rpc.ts` entries), `apps/server/src/notes/`, and `apps/web/src/features/notes/`. Replace them with your own domain and everything else keeps working.

| `packages/shared`         | Cross-app utilities: port finding, readiness probes, atomic writes. Subpath imports only |
| `scripts`                 | Dev runner, desktop packaging, `.repos` sync — dependency-free where it matters          |
| `docs/adr`                | Six short records of every decision you might otherwise be tempted to revisit            |
| `.repos`                  | Vendored, read-only Effect source for reference — never imported, never edited           |

## ❤️ Built on T3 Code

This starter is distilled from [**T3 Code**](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) — the shell-supervised server, the schema contracts, the connection supervisor, even the tooling choices all trace back to patterns it pioneered. If you want to see them driving a real product, go read that codebase. Huge thanks to the T3 team. 🙏
